This project initially started out to be a 3D printer capable of printing almost every single part of itself (hence the name, Self Replicator 1), but eventually evolved into creating a 3D printer that could outperform the top of the line printers of early 2024. However, since that time, it is very likely that this printer has long been surpassed by the latest advancements in the technology. While this project was never built, I estimated it to be capable of ~1000 mm/s and quote-unquote "good" acceleration. I made this project like a whole year ago and Imma be honest, I kinda forgot about it. All I remember are those two facts and the fact that it was designed to be faster than a BambuLab X1. It probably could never get there, but who knows. Maybe you can figure out everything because I missed something in my skimming of the google site I made ages ago. Have a gander of that and even MORE documentation over at *FUTURE ME PUT SITE HERE

If for some reason making one of these piques your interest, it's pretty similar to building a Voron, but you have no documentation, no instructuions, and an unfinished project that may or may not be complete and utter garbage. If you want to build off of this and upload it elsewhere, go right on ahead. (though a little note of credit would be nice)

## Features
Assuming you build this, design enclosures for all the electronics and find some way to wire them all together, then assuming you can figure out how to code it correctly, then assuming it works as intended, you'll get a host of features such as:
 - Input shaping
 - Speedy prints
 - Probably inadequate cooling
 - 4-axis bed leveling
 - 3D printable parts with no supports
 - Enclosure for printing those smelly filaments
 - Probably an all color touchscreen (?)
 - The bragging rights to say that you built your own 3D printer
 - Who knows man I probably forgot a ton of things

## Materials
For all of the printed parts, make sure you use ABS or better due to the high temperatures. Printed parts can be seperated from the bought parts by methods lost to the sands of time, but I'm pretty sure most of them are just marked with a black color in Solidworks. If your're using a different program, then it might transfer the colors, but I'm not sure on that. 

A comprehensive materials list can be found below. At the time that this was put together (May 2024), total costs were around $1300, but are probably much higher now.

## Known Issues
There's probably much more that I'm missing, but this should get you started if you for some reason want to fix the junk that I uploaded
 - No electronic models or enclousures. Power supply is there, but that's about it. 
 - Complete lack of real world testing
 - There are no screws or fasteners in the model
 - Cooling is probably sub-par for such a fast printer
 - Enclosure acryllic is lacking holes in places
 - Enclosure acryllic clips into stepper motors when closing top lid
 - There's no places for the belt pullies to attach to the mechanisms
 - Still using a BL Touch
 - Needs paths and holes for filament to go through
 - Software and presets have never existed in the history of ever

## Random stuff
  - This assembly uses the models for a high-flow 3D printer hotend made by Sandman on GrabCad ([https://grabcad.com/library/phaetus-rapido-hf-hotend-1](url)), a bed leveling sensor by Findusdwarf ([https://grabcad.com/library/cr-touch-dummy-1](url)), and a 3D printer extruder by anderfogel, also on GrabCad.
